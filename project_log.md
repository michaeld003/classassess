Week Ending: 29/11
Accomplishments:

- After submitting the interim report, I looked at my software architecture again and started thinking about switching to React for the front-end and Node.js for handling API logic, while keeping MySQL as the database. Since I haven’t worked with React or Node.js before, I’ll need to research and learn more about them before deciding if they’re the right choice for my project.

Tasks for next week:

-Review my software architecture and continue exploring how React and Node.js could fit into the project.
-Learn the basics of React and how to set up a front-end development environment.
-Research Node.js and how it can handle API logic, working alongside MySQL as the database.
-Set up a GitLab repository with a clear structure for the front-end, back-end, and database scripts.
- Finalise the database schema and create the initial tables in MySQL.
- Experiment with setting up a simple Node.js server and connecting it to a MySQL database.
- Try building a basic React application and test making API calls to a backend server.
